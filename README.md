# 📈 Linear Regression on Advertising Data

A comprehensive machine learning project that builds a Linear Regression model to analyze and predict sales based on advertising expenditures across different media channels (TV, Radio, and Newspaper).

## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end process of building a predictive model:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing** to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Model Training** using Scikit-Learn's Linear Regression.
- **Model Evaluation** using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.

The goal is to determine how different advertising budgets influence product sales, providing actionable insights for marketing strategy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset (`Advertising.csv`) contains information about advertising budgets spent on three media channels and the corresponding sales figures.
- **Features:**
  - `TV`: Advertising budget spent on TV (in thousands of dollars)
  - `Radio`: Advertising budget spent on Radio
  - `Newspaper`: Advertising budget spent on Newspaper
- **Target Variable:**
  - `Sales`: Product sales (in thousands of units)

## 🚀 Getting Started
